# Data_Analysis_and_Visualization
The basic idea of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create interactive visualizations for a sales dataset. This project will leverage various Python programming concepts, including data types, variables, functions, file operations, error handling, object-oriented programming, GUI, and data analysis and visualization.

The main problem to be solved with this project is to derive actionable insights from a sales dataset through EDA and interactive visualization. This involves collecting a sales dataset, cleaning, and organizing the data, and employing statistical and visual exploration techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations. The project aims to address challenges related to data consistency, missing values, and overall data quality. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sales data, facilitating informed decision-making for business strategies and highlighting areas for potential improvement. These techniques can also be tailored to any other kind of dataset such as data from sensors.

My implementation makes use of the following packages/modules: pandas, matplotlib, plotly, tkinter, to mention a few. Pandas is employed to read the CSV file containing the dataset and create a structured DataFrame. Utilizing Python's data preparation capabilities, I handled missing values and ensured data consistency. For the EDA, statistical analysis is conducted using Pandas. Trends over time is explored through line and area charts. For deeper insights, correlations between variables are identified. The Data Visualization phase includes dynamic and interactive visualizations implemented with Plotly, offering a more engaging user experience.

The project adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, implementing a structured code with classes for data handling and visualization. This approach enhances code organization and maintainability. Finally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed using Tkinter, allowing users to interactively select and customize visualizations based on different aspects of the sales data.
